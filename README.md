## Topic

[Numpy to PyTorch](https://2018.pycon.ca/talks/talk-PC-53293/)

## Presentation

* [Slides](https://slides.com/shagunsodhani/pycon2018)
* [Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zEFCe68fJvdJHwTo8X-dCHunxNDAIFep)

Remember to select the hardware as "GPU" when running the code on colaboratory by selecting`Runtime`, followed by `Change runtime type`

For running the notebook locally, the only dependencies are [Numpy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
